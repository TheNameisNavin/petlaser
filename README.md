# petlaser

This project features an automated laser toy built to entertain pets, powered by an Arduino-controlled pan-and-tilt system. It uses SG90 servos to guide a laser pointer through smooth, predefined motion patterns, creating an engaging and interactive play experience. The servos are mounted on a custom 3D-printed pan-and-tilt mechanism, enabling precise control over the laserâ€™s movement.

The system moves the laser along a series of programmed coordinates, with the servos transitioning smoothly between mapped angles. The laser stays active as the servos make incremental movements, mimicking random motion to keep pets captivated.
